# XPy - The XPython Framework
**A great collection of simple or even complex functions and classes that are made to help extend the functionality of Python as a Programming Language.** <br>

## What exactly is the XPy or XPython? <br>
**I always wanted to make my own programming language**, but unfortunately due to some problems, I just realized that it would really be a hard task, So after a lot of thinking, I finally decided to make this a Framework for the **Python Programming Language**. <br>

## Features : <br>

* **Free** and **open-source** (of course, You have the source code here!) <br>
* Can be manually expanded by you (Customizable!) <br>
* It also provides you the capabilities of **Batch** and **Bash**, all in one **Python Framework!**. <br>

## Is it the time to ditch them? <br>
Of course!, But just wait, as this framework is still under heavy development stage. <br>

## Examples using this framework: <br>

```py
from xpy.builtins import *
# To be used to print a word in the console screen (exactly the same as print method in Python's builtins, but it doesn't take any other arguments)
x.show("Hello, World!")
# Use this code to rename a file (old file name, new file name)
x.ren(r"C:\Users\Insertx2k Dev\Desktop\ren.md", r"C:\Users\Insertx2k Dev\Desktop\ren.x")

# Use this code to delete a file.
x.rem(r"C:\Users\Insertx2k Dev\Desktop\ren.md") # -> use this to delete a file.

# Get a list of all displays attached to this system.
x.get_disps()
# Returns a list containing the names of all attached displays to this system.

# And much more!!...
```

<br>

### Note : <br>

Supported file extentions for the XPy or XPython framework are `.x` or `.py` or `.pyw` or `.xw`, **Choose whatever you want.**, but the `.x` and `.xw` are the standard extensions of this **Framework.** <br>

<br>

`.py` - Stands for a **Python** source file **(Console Window)** <br>
`.pyw` - Stands for a **Python** source file **(No Console Window is shown)** <br>
`.x` - Stands for an **XPython** source file, Can be used too for **Python** Source Files. <br>
`.xw` - Stands for an **XPython** source file, Can be used too for **Python** Source Files. **(No Console Window is shown)**
